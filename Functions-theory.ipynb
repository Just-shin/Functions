    "Answer - \n",
    "    In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "    Function >> \n",
    "        In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be called again and again as per requirement. Functions are defined by 'def' keywords. Functions can be called directly by their name, and they can be used anywhere in the code.\n",
    "        Example-def add(a, b):\n",
    "                    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "                result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "                print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "    Method >>\n",
    "        A method, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object. It operates on the data contained within the object,\n",
    "        also defined using the def keyword, but it must include self as their first parameter.Methods are called on objects, and they can access and modify the objectâ€™s attributes.\n",
    "        Example-class Calculator:\n",
    "                    def add(self, a, b):\n",
    "                        return a + b\n",

    "                print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "    Key differences >> \n",
    "    Association:\n",
    "        Functions are independent and not associated with any object.\n",
    "        Methods are associated with objects and classes.\n",
    "    Calling:\n",
    "        Functions can be called by their name directly.  \n",
    "        Methods need to be called on an instance of a class.\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, the terms arguments and parameters are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings:\n",
    "    Parameters >> \n",
    "        Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that the function will operate on. Parameters allow functions to be generalized and reusable. They enable us to write code that can work with different values each time the function is called. example :\n",
    "        def greet(name):   ##here name is parameter.\n",
    "            print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "        Arguments >> \n",
    "        Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters. It might be a variable, value or object passed to a function or method as input. Arguments provide the specific data that the function needs to perform its operations. Example :\n",
    "        greet(\"Alice\") #here \"Alice\" is an argument passed to the 'greet' function.\n",
    "        Types of Arguments in Python:\n",
    "        Positional Arguments:\n",
    "        These are passed to the function in the order they are defined in the parameter list.\n",
    "        Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "        These are passed with the parameter name, allowing you to specify the value for a particular parameter explicitly. The order does not matter.\n",
    "        Default Arguments:\n",
    "        These are parameters with predefined values that are used if no corresponding argument is provided during the function call.\n",
    "        Variable-Length Arguments:\n",
    "        These allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, using *args for positional arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments.\n",
    "    Differences between them >> \n",
    "    Parameters exist only within the function definition and act as placeholders, while arguments are the values passed from outside the function when it's called. Parameters define the type and number of inputs a function can accept, while arguments provide the actual data for those inputs.\n"

    "    The map() function in Python is a built-in function that allows to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return a map object (which is an iterator) containing the results. This is particularly useful for transforming data efficiently and concisely.\n",
